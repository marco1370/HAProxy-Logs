Customizing the HAProxy Logs

There are plenty of reasons why you might want to customize the fields captured by the HAProxy logs. For example :

the default log format is giving you more information that you need

youâ€™re missing an important piece of information with the default log format
you need to structure the fields in a way that an external tool can read them
you rely on a standard log format and HAProxy must also comply


At the moment, the default HTTP format is defined this way :

    log-format "%ci:%cp [%tr] %ft %b/%s %TR/%Tw/%Tc/%Tr/%Ta %ST %B %CC \
                %CS %tsc %ac/%fc/%bc/%sc/%rc %sq/%bq %hr %hs %{+Q}r"
